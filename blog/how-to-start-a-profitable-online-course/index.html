They need to be able to address all the questions and issues that learners are facing.</p><p>In this article, I will guide you through specific steps to focus on. This is not a comprehensive and detailed article on what needs to be done, but you will get an overview of the process of successfully creating and selling online courses.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mle-courses-prod/users/6423ad9fa251d4001aac162e/private-files/672feb90-6191-11ee-a622-d5adf584cf0d-Screenshot%202023-10-03%20at%2009.05.49.png" alt="i0" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Before starting to sell courses, course creators often have many questions:</p><ul><li>How do I get started?</li><li>How long does it take to create a course?</li><li>What is the cost of creating a course?</li><li>How can the course interact with users?</li><li>How do I successfully sell the course to learners?</li></ul><p>However, after considering the following steps, you will have a better understanding of the process of creating an online course, enabling you to leverage your knowledge for personal profit!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-how-to-create-a-new-course">1. How to Create a New Course?<a class="hash-link" href="#1-how-to-create-a-new-course" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To create a new online course, you need patience, specialized knowledge or skills, experience, passion, and dedication, along with a reliable eLearning platform to help you organize your lessons. Remember that passion for your field of expertise will make this process easier for you.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-how-long-does-it-take-to-create-an-online-course">2. How long does it take to create an online course?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-how-long-does-it-take-to-create-an-online-course" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mle-courses-prod/users/6423ad9fa251d4001aac162e/private-files/5e65f040-61c3-11ee-b606-83af89a0f126-best-online-course-platforms.webp" alt="i1" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The time required to create an online course largely depends on the amount of lectures and materials you already have. If you already possess materials such as PDFs, videos, SCORM content, live session recordings, and quizzes, you can simply upload them to eLearning platforms that support online course creation and organize them into a structured course. The key is to develop a structured and educational curriculum from the content you&#x27;ve uploaded.</p><p>Therefore, the duration will vary from person to person. If you&#x27;re starting from scratch, try to identify the topic you want to teach, your strengths, and refer to some existing courses on the market. From there, you will understand how to structure and develop the teaching content for your own course and start building from there.</p><p>Choosing a reputable platform that integrates many supporting tools is a smart decision that can save you a lot of time and enhance your work efficiency. Instead of having to search for and integrate each tool individually, a reliable platform will provide a comprehensive solution, allowing you to focus on more important tasks and ensuring stable and effective work performance. This can drive your development and success in your work or project. <a href="https://coursemind.io/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CourseMind</a> and some other online education platforms like LearnWord and Hoola might be the optimal choices for you at this stage.</p><p>You can create a quality course in just a few sessions if you have a clear idea of your curriculum. This makes creating an online course much simpler compared to self-hosting or uploading it to groups on Facebook or YouTube in a less professional manner.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-how-much-does-it-cost-to-create-an-online-course">3. How much does it cost to create an online course?<a class="hash-link" href="#3-how-much-does-it-cost-to-create-an-online-course" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mle-courses-prod/users/6423ad9fa251d4001aac162e/private-files/e8369c60-6138-11ee-b606-83af89a0f126-ba0103.jpeg" alt="i3" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Before embarking on creating an online course, you need to carefully consider potential expenses. First, there are equipment costs such as microphones, video recording devices, and other technical tools. Next, there are expenses for materials if you want to invest in reference materials or a platform for selling the course. Additionally, you should also take into account marketing expenses to reach your target audience, as well as opportunity costs – the time you need to invest in creating and managing the course. However, for those who see this investment as an opportunity to share knowledge and earn future profits, these costs can be seen as a valuable and sustainable investment.</p><p>Among these costs, platform fees are the easiest to compare. Currently, most online course platforms charge monthly fees ranging from tens to hundreds of dollars, depending on your needs and scale, with various supporting features. For example, you can use some popular platforms in Vietnam such as <a href="https://coursemind.io/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CourseMind</a>, Edubit, Hoola, Daymai,... or create videos without significant investment. However, some people invest heavily in producing professional videos, creating SCORM files, and producing high-quality content. What matters most is the quality of the course you create.</p><p>If you have limited budget or aren&#x27;t ready to invest heavily when you&#x27;re unsure about the revenue potential of your course, you can consider looking for platforms that offer free trials or payment only after you&#x27;ve successfully sold your course. In the case of wanting to try before paying, you can use the free 2-month trial at CourseMind. Afterward, if you&#x27;re not ready for monthly payments, you can choose the &quot;Share revenue&quot; program offered by CourseMind or some other foreign platforms: You&#x27;ll only need to allocate around 10% of your revenue to the platform when you successfully sell your course.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-how-to-create-an-interactive-online-course">4.

Researching and determining these interactions should be part of your planning process. Firstly, your lecture slides should be creative and engaging to capture the interest of your students. Secondly, your presentation should be lively, creative, incorporating stories, and encouraging student interaction throughout the learning process.</p><p>Additionally, you can use small quizzes after each lesson to help students interact with the content and review what they&#x27;ve learned. Furthermore, you can include small questions during your lectures to maintain engagement and receive feedback from your students. In this aspect, you should seek platforms that support maximum interaction with your students, such as discussion forums below each lecture, assignments, quizzes, or systems for emails and reminders. These tools will not only facilitate interaction but also save you a significant amount of time and effort.</p><p>For reference, you can explore a highly interactive course here: <a href="https://coursemind.io/courses/61b7081639320455cc70848b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-how-to-create-a-profitable-online-course">5.
